# Cursor Bundle Policies v6.9.163
# Enhanced Enterprise-Grade Policies and Standards

## Version Management Policies

### Artifact Management
* Each logical file maintains exactly one versioned artifact, suffixed with `_v6.9.163`
* Legacy duplicates from previous versions (v6.9.35–v6.9.162) are systematically removed
* Version strings are updated atomically before file operations to prevent missing-file warnings
* All operations are idempotent: skips moves when source equals destination, validates file existence before actions

### Release Branch Strategy
* Commits are made on dedicated release branch `release/v6.9.163` to avoid tag naming conflicts
* Both release branch and version tag `v6.9.163` are pushed to origin remote simultaneously
* Release branches follow GitFlow methodology with proper merge strategies

## Security Policies

### Code Security Standards
* All shell scripts must use strict error handling: `set -euo pipefail`
* Comprehensive error handling library usage required for all shell scripts
* Replace `|| true` patterns with `safe_ignore()` function with proper reasoning
* Error logging with context and severity levels for all failure scenarios
* Python code requires type hints and comprehensive error handling
* Input validation mandatory for all user-facing interfaces
* No hardcoded secrets or credentials in source code

### Error Handling Guidelines
* Use `safe_execute()` for commands that should fail fast with proper error reporting
* Use `safe_ignore()` only when command failure is acceptable, with documented reason
* Use `safe_execute_with_retry()` for transient failures (network, resource contention)
* All error handlers must include context information and structured logging
* Critical errors must generate comprehensive error dumps for debugging
* Error recovery mechanisms should be implemented where feasible

### Container Security Requirements
* All containers run as non-root user (UID 1000)
* Read-only root filesystem enforcement
* Capability dropping (ALL) with selective additions (NET_BIND_SERVICE only)
* Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal attack surface
* Vulnerability scanning before deployment (Grype, Trivy)

### Network Security Controls
* mTLS encryption for all service-to-service communication via Istio
* Network policies for micro-segmentation
* WAF protection at API Gateway layer
* TLS 1.3 minimum for external communications

## Quality Assurance Policies

### Testing Requirements
* Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
* Integration tests for all API endpoints
* Performance testing for each release
* Security testing including SAST/DAST scans

### Documentation Standards
* Comprehensive README with architecture diagrams
* API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
* Inline code documentation for all public functions
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant changes

### Build and Deployment Standards
* Multi-environment Terraform infrastructure (dev/staging/prod)
* Kubernetes deployments with resource limits and health checks
* Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases
* Automated rollback capabilities within 5 minutes

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Trail Generation
* Extensive context files generated and committed with each release:
  - Git diff summaries and change logs
  - Dependency analysis and security audit results
  - Test results and coverage reports
  - Build artifacts and static analysis reports
  - Performance benchmarks and CI workflow results
  - Code metrics and technical debt analysis
  - Security scan results and vulnerability assessments

### Compliance Documentation
* SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation for supply chain security
* Artifact signing with GPG for integrity verification
* Comprehensive logging for all system interactions
* Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Data Management
* Encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive data
* GDPR compliance with data subject rights implementation
* Backup and disaster recovery procedures with 4-hour RTO
* Data retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements

## Operational Excellence

### Monitoring and Observability
* OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with Jaeger
* Prometheus metrics collection with custom dashboards
* Centralized logging with FluentBit and Loki
* SLA monitoring with 99.9% availability target

### Incident Response
* Severity-based response times (Critical: 15 minutes, High: 1 hour)
* Automated alerting with PagerDuty integration
* Post-incident reviews and improvement planning
* Disaster recovery testing quarterly

### Access Control
* Role-based access control (RBAC) with least privilege principle
* Multi-factor authentication for all privileged access
* Regular access reviews and privilege auditing
* Service account management with automatic rotation

## Change Management

### Version Control Standards
* Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
* Signed commits for all production releases
* Branch protection rules with required status checks
* Peer review requirements for all code changes

### Release Process
* Automated CI/CD pipeline with security gates
* Environment promotion strategy: dev → staging → production
* Feature flags for gradual rollout
* Automated testing at each promotion stage

### Emergency Procedures
* Emergency change process for critical security fixes
* Incident commander role assignment
* Communication protocols for stakeholder notification
* Post-emergency review and process improvement

## Technology Stack Policies

### Infrastructure as Code
* All infrastructure defined in version-controlled Terraform modules
* Environment-specific configurations with shared modules
* Resource tagging for cost allocation and compliance
* Infrastructure testing and validation in CI/CD pipeline

### Container Platform Standards
* Kubernetes cluster with RBAC and network policies
* Istio service mesh for advanced traffic management
* Kong API Gateway with comprehensive plugin ecosystem
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU and memory metrics

### Observability Stack
* Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
* Grafana for visualization and dashboards
* Jaeger for distributed tracing
* Loki for log aggregation and analysis

## Policy Enforcement

### Automated Enforcement
* Pre-commit hooks for code quality and security checks
* CI/CD pipeline gates for policy compliance
* Kubernetes admission controllers for runtime policy enforcement
* Automated remediation for common policy violations

### Manual Reviews
* Architecture review for significant design changes
* Security review for all external integrations
* Performance review for resource-intensive features
* Compliance review for regulatory requirements

### Training and Awareness
* Regular security awareness training
* Policy update notifications and training
* Role-specific training for specialized responsibilities
* Incident-based training after policy violations
