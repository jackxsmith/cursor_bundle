# Policy for Running the Upgrade Script

This repository includes a single automated upgrade script (`upgrade_to_v6_9_33_v.sh`) that performs all necessary version updates and pushes them to GitHub. To use it:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run `bash upgrade_to_v6_9_33_v.sh` from the repository directory or your Downloads folder.
3. **Do not use `sudo`** when running the script. Running as a normal user ensures your Git configuration and SSH credentials are used properly. Using `sudo` may cause authentication failures when pushing to GitHub.

No other manual intervention is required. Once the script finishes successfully, the repository will be fully updated.
