# Policies v6.9.51
* Exactly one artefact/log is kept for each logical file, suffixed `_v6.9.51`.  Older duplicates (v6.9.35–50) are removed.
* Version strings are updated before renaming, preventing missing‑file warnings.
* The script is idempotent: it skips moves if the source and destination are the same, and checks that files exist before acting.
* Lint results are written to `lint_report_v6.9.51.txt`.
* Commit, tag and push to the `origin` remote are done automatically at the end.
