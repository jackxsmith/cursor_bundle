# Policies v6.9.53
* Exactly one artefact/log is kept for each logical file, suffixed `_v6.9.53`.  Older duplicates (v6.9.35–52) are removed.
* Version strings are updated before renaming, preventing missing‑file warnings.
* The script is idempotent: it skips moves if the source and destination are the same, and checks that files exist before acting.
* Lint results are written to `lint_report_v6.9.53.txt`.
* Commits are made on a new branch named after the version (`v6.9.53`).  If a tag with the same name already exists, the branch will be prefixed `release/` to avoid conflicts when pushing.  Both the branch and the tag are pushed to the `origin` remote.
