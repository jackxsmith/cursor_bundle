# Policies v6.9.56
* Exactly one artefact/log is kept for each logical file, suffixed `_v6.9.56`.  Older duplicates (v6.9.35–55) are removed.
* Version strings are updated before renaming, preventing missing‑file warnings.
* The script is idempotent: it skips moves if the source and destination are the same, and checks that files exist before acting.
* Lint results are written to `lint_report_v6.9.56.txt`.
* Commits are made on a new branch named `release/v6.9.56` to avoid naming conflicts with the tag `v6.9.56`.  Both the branch and the tag are pushed to the `origin` remote.
* Additional context files (diff, log, extended metadata and README) plus a webhook configuration template are created and committed with this branch to aid in history inspection and debugging.
