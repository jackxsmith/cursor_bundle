> **AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENT**: This is the single source of truth for all Cursor Bundle policies. All other policy documents are deprecated and superseded by this consolidated version.

## üéØ CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED POLICIES

### LESSON 1: NEVER STOP VERIFICATION POLICY

**MANDATORY POLICY:**
```
NEVER STOP UNTIL VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE
- Continue verification loops until user confirms success
- No stopping after commits - immediately continue monitoring
- No assumptions that changes worked - verify continuously
- If verification fails, immediately start next iteration
```

**Violation Prevention:**
- User must explicitly confirm completion before stopping
- Create automatic verification loops that don't exit until success
- Never assume changes worked without verification

### LESSON 2: MANDATORY VERSION BUMPING POLICY

**MANDATORY POLICY:**
```
ALWAYS USE EXISTING BUMP FUNCTIONS
- Never manually edit VERSION file - use existing bump functions
- Always use ./bump.sh or ./bump_merged.sh scripts
- Let bump scripts handle branch creation and version management
- Never bypass the established bump workflow
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use existing bump scripts
./bump.sh 6.9.XXX    # or ./bump_merged.sh 6.9.XXX

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Manual version editing
echo "6.9.XXX" > VERSION  # NEVER DO THIS
git add VERSION           # NEVER DO THIS
```

### LESSON 3: GITHUB API AS PRIMARY VERIFICATION

**MANDATORY POLICY:**
```
GITHUB API MUST BE PRIMARY VERIFICATION METHOD
- Always check API before visual verification
- Never rely solely on WebFetch for status checking
- Use curl + jq for definitive status confirmation
```

**Mandatory API Commands:**
```bash
# PRIMARY verification command (MUST RUN EVERY TIME)
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/jackxsmith/cursor_bundle/commits/main/check-runs" | jq -r '.check_runs[] | "\(.name): \(.status) - \(.conclusion)"'

# Expected success output:
# check: completed - success
# container-security: completed - success  
# security-scan: completed - success
# perf-test: completed - success
# build: completed - success
```

### LESSON 4: GITHUB ACTIONS JOB DEPENDENCIES PROHIBITION

**MANDATORY POLICY:**
```yaml
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Parallel execution (NO dependencies)
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    
  perf-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    # NO 'needs: build' dependency
    
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    # NO 'needs: build' dependency

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Dependencies create bottlenecks
jobs:
  perf-test:
    needs: build  # NEVER USE THIS
```

**Root Cause Prevention:**
- Job dependencies create bottlenecks where dependent jobs wait for build job
- Build job timeouts block all dependent jobs causing 4/5 status
- Parallel execution prevents single points of failure

### LESSON 5: SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION APPROACH

**MANDATORY POLICY:**
```
SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING APPROACH:
1. Check GitHub API for exact status first
2. Identify all expected jobs/workflows 
3. Map 1:1 what's expected vs actual
4. Use API to pinpoint failing components
5. Fix root cause, not symptoms
6. Verify fix with API before declaring success
```

### LESSON 6: POLICY DOCUMENTATION CONSOLIDATION

**MANDATORY POLICY:**
```
SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR POLICIES:
- Never scatter policies across multiple documents
- Consolidate all policies into one authoritative document
- Deprecate and remove duplicate policy files
- Reference single policy document from all locations
```

**Implementation:**
This document (`CONSOLIDATED_POLICIES.md`) supersedes:
- ‚ùå `VERIFICATION_POLICY.md` (DEPRECATED)
- ‚ùå `LESSONS_LEARNED_POLICY.md` (DEPRECATED) 
- ‚ùå Multiple policy sections in `POLICIES.md` (SUPERSEDED)

## üîÑ VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### Mandatory Verification Loop
```bash
while true; do
    # 1. MANDATORY API Check
    api_result=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/jackxsmith/cursor_bundle/commits/main/check-runs" | jq -r '.check_runs[] | "\(.name): \(.status) - \(.conclusion)"')
    
    # 2. Count successful completions
    success_count=$(echo "$api_result" | grep -c "completed - success")
    expected_jobs=5
    
    # 3. Check completion
    if [[ $success_count -eq $expected_jobs ]]; then
        echo "‚úì API Verification complete: All $expected_jobs jobs successful"
        echo "$api_result"
        break
    else
        echo "‚è≥ Continuing verification... ($success_count/$expected_jobs successful)"
        echo "$api_result"
        sleep 60
    fi
done
```

### Version Bump Protocol
```bash
# MANDATORY: Use existing bump scripts
./bump.sh $(echo "$(cat VERSION | cut -d. -f1-2).$(expr $(cat VERSION | cut -d. -f3) + 1)")

# FORBIDDEN: Manual version management
# echo "x.x.x" > VERSION  # NEVER DO THIS
```

## üìä IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Every GitHub Operation Must Include:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Use bump script instead of manual VERSION editing
- [ ] ‚úÖ API verification before declaring success
- [ ] ‚úÖ No job dependencies unless critical
- [ ] ‚úÖ Timeout limits on all jobs (5-30 minutes)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Continuous verification until user confirms
- [ ] ‚úÖ Multiple verification methods
- [ ] ‚úÖ Systematic debugging if issues arise
- [ ] ‚úÖ Clear communication of status

### Never Do:
- [ ] ‚ùå Stop verification without user confirmation
- [ ] ‚ùå Manually edit VERSION file
- [ ] ‚ùå Use job dependencies unnecessarily  
- [ ] ‚ùå Rely solely on visual verification
- [ ] ‚ùå Make assumptions about success
- [ ] ‚ùå Skip API verification step
- [ ] ‚ùå Give up without root cause analysis
- [ ] ‚ùå Scatter policies across multiple documents
