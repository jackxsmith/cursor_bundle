# Docker Status - Cursor Bundle v6.9.33

## Current Status: ⚠️ DOCKER BUILD FAILS

### Issue Identified:
Docker build fails in sandbox environment due to:
- iptables kernel module issues
- Network bridge configuration problems
- Sandbox environment limitations

### Error Details:
```
iptables v1.8.7 (legacy): can't initialize iptables table `raw': Table does not exist
(do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
```

### Docker Files Included:
✅ Dockerfile (syntax valid, but build fails)
✅ docker-compose.yml (configuration valid)
✅ 15-docker_install_v6.9.33.sh (script functional)
✅ docker-supervisor.conf (configuration ready)

### Recommendation:
- Docker files are included for reference
- May work in proper Docker environments
- Requires testing outside sandbox environment
- Not guaranteed to work without modifications

### Working Installation Methods:
✅ Enhanced installer: ./14-install_v6.9.33_enhanced.sh
✅ All other installation methods tested and working
