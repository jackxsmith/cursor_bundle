This branch was created from the previous version tag `v6.9.55`.  All version strings were updated to `6.9.56`, duplicate artefacts were removed, and new artefacts were suffixed with `_6.9.56`.  A fresh lint was run, and the upgrade script committed the changes on this branch and pushed both the branch and the tag `v6.9.56` to the remote.
