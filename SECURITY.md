- **Vulnerability remediation time**: Per severity SLA
- **Security training completion**: 100% annually

## üîÑ Incident Response

### Security Incident Categories

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Failed authentication, privilege escalation
2. **Malware Detection**: Virus, ransomware, suspicious activity
3. **Data Breach**: Unauthorized data access or exfiltration
4. **DDoS Attack**: Service disruption attempts
5. **Insider Threat**: Malicious or negligent employee actions

### Response Team

- **Incident Commander**: Overall response coordination
- **Security Analyst**: Technical investigation and forensics
- **IT Operations**: System isolation and recovery
- **Legal Counsel**: Regulatory and legal compliance
- **Communications**: Stakeholder and customer notifications

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection & Analysis** (0-15 minutes)
   - Automated alert or manual detection
   - Initial triage and severity assessment
   - Incident team activation

2. **Containment** (15-60 minutes)
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence for forensics
   - Implement temporary fixes

3. **Eradication & Recovery** (1-24 hours)
   - Remove threat from environment

## üèÜ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Input validation
def process_user_input(user_data: str) -> str:
    # Validate input length
    if len(user_data) > MAX_INPUT_LENGTH:
        raise ValueError("Input too long")
    
    # Sanitize input
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[<>"\']', '', user_data)
    
    # Validate against allowed patterns
    if not ALLOWED_PATTERN.match(sanitized):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    
    return sanitized

# ‚ùå Bad: No input validation
def process_user_input(user_data: str) -> str:
    return user_data  # Dangerous!
```

### For Infrastructure

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Good: Secure Kubernetes deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        fsGroup: 1000
      containers:
      - name: app
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          capabilities:
            drop: ["ALL"]
            add: ["NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
```

### For Operations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
