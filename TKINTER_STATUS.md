# Tkinter Status – Cursor Bundle v6.9.35

## Current Status: ⚠️ Unverified

### What Was Added
- A new script `07-tkinter_v6.9.35_fixed.py` providing a minimal
  Tkinter‑based GUI installer.
- The GUI offers **Install** and **Uninstall** buttons and displays
  an indeterminate progress bar while calling the standard shell
  installer.

### What Has Not Been Tested
- Running the Tkinter installer in an actual desktop environment
  (due to the sandboxed environment lacking a display server).
- Verifying that the progress bar and message boxes behave correctly
  under various failure conditions.
- Ensuring that the required `tkinter` module is available on all
  supported platforms.

### Known Limitations
- The Tkinter GUI requires access to an X11/Wayland display and the
  `python3-tk` package installed.  In headless or minimal setups this
  may not be present.
- The installer simply wraps the shell script and does not provide
  advanced error recovery or update checks.

### Recommendation
- Use the enhanced installer (`14-install_v6.9.35_enhanced.sh`) for
  automated installations.
- The Tkinter installer is provided as a fallback option when
  `zenity` is unavailable and a GUI environment is present.
