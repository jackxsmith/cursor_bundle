## üéØ CRITICAL OPERATIONAL POLICIES

### 1. Comprehensive Testing and Validation Policy

**MANDATORY**: ALL installation scripts MUST be tested individually before claiming completion.

**Required Actions**:
- Discover ALL items using systematic tools (`find`, `grep`)
- Test 100% of discovered items, never sample
- Document ALL errors encountered with evidence
- Fix ALL errors and verify fixes work
- Complete end-to-end validation

**Enforcement**: Zero tolerance for incomplete testing. Finding untested items after "completion" constitutes a critical policy violation.

### 2. Mistake Pattern Prevention Policy

**MANDATORY**: Implement systematic learning to prevent recurring mistakes.

**Identified Recurring Patterns**:
1. **Incomplete Testing**: Testing samples instead of complete sets
2. **Premature Completion**: Claiming "done" before full verification  
3. **Policy Shortcuts**: Skipping mandatory steps
4. **Assumption-Based Development**: Making decisions without verification

**Prevention Mechanisms**:
- Maintain mistake history database
- Implement pattern-specific countermeasures
- Use automated pattern detection
- Require evidence-based validation

### 3. Version Control and Deployment Policy

**MANDATORY**: Every completed task MUST end with version bump to GitHub.

**Required Sequence**:
1. Complete all work and testing
2. Update VERSION file with new number
3. Commit changes with descriptive message
4. Create release branch (release/vX.Y.Z)
5. Push to GitHub with branch verification
6. Confirm branch visibility on GitHub

**Enforcement**: No exceptions. All work must conclude with proper versioning and deployment.

### 4. Policy Compliance Enforcement

**MANDATORY**: Systematic safeguards to prevent policy violations.

**Prevention Strategy**:
- Pre-task policy review and checklist creation
- Progressive compliance checking during work
- Evidence collection and verification
- Emergency protocols for violation detection

**Accountability**: Explicit policy citations required for all decisions.

### 5. Task Completion Priority Policy

**MANDATORY**: Complete ALL pending tasks before accepting new ones.

**Required Protocol**:
- Review todo list before accepting new tasks
- Complete tasks in order of priority and dependencies
- Mark tasks as completed only when fully verified
- Never start new work with pending high-priority tasks

**Enforcement**: Violation of task completion order constitutes a critical policy breach.

### 6. Bug Prevention and Quality Assurance Policy

**MANDATORY**: Systematic approaches to minimize bugs in new versions.

**Pre-Development Quality Gates**:
- Comprehensive requirements analysis before coding
- Review existing functionality to understand impact
- Create test cases before implementing changes
- Validate all dependencies and integrations

**Development Quality Standards**:
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles
- Implement defensive programming practices
- Use static analysis tools and linters
- Conduct code reviews for all changes
- Document all assumptions and edge cases

**Pre-Release Quality Verification**:
- Execute ALL automated tests (unit, integration, system)
- Perform manual regression testing on core features
- Test in multiple environments (dev, staging, production-like)
- Validate backwards compatibility
- Check for breaking changes and document them

**Release Quality Assurance**:
- Run security scans and vulnerability assessments
- Verify all configuration files and environment variables
- Test rollback procedures before deployment
- Monitor system health during and after deployment
- Maintain rollback capability for 24 hours post-release

**Post-Release Monitoring**:
- Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- Track user feedback and bug reports
- Implement hotfix procedures for critical issues
- Conduct post-mortem analysis for any incidents

**Bug Root Cause Analysis**:
- Document all bugs with reproduction steps
- Identify root cause categories (logic, integration, configuration, etc.)
- Update prevention measures based on bug patterns
- Improve testing coverage for discovered gaps

**Enforcement**: Any release causing system downtime or data loss triggers mandatory policy review and strengthening.

## üîç SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### Feature Discovery Protocol
```bash
# NEVER test samples - discover ALL items
find . -name "pattern*" -type f | wc -l
grep -r "pattern" --include="*.ext" . | wc -l
# Verify counts match expectations
```

### Complete Testing Protocol
```bash
# Test EVERY discovered item
for item in $(find . -name "pattern*"); do
    echo "Testing: $item"
    test_command "$item" 2>&1 | tee -a results.log
    verify_result "$item"
done
```

### Completion Verification Protocol
```bash
echo "=== COMPLETION VERIFICATION ==="
echo "1. All items discovered and tested: $(verify_complete_testing)"
echo "2. All fixes implemented and verified: $(verify_fixes)"  
echo "3. All documentation updated: $(verify_docs)"
echo "4. All policies complied with: $(verify_compliance)"
echo "5. All changes deployed to GitHub: $(verify_deployment)"
```

## üìã WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION POLICIES

### Interruption Minimization Policy

**POLICY**: Minimize unnecessary interruptions while maintaining quality.

**Approaches**:
1. **Assume Sensible Defaults**: Use repository patterns and conventions
2. **Batch Questions**: Group related questions into single interactions
3. **Use Context Clues**: Infer intent from available information
4. **Take Initiative**: Start with most likely solution
5. **Document Assumptions**: State reasoning for easy correction

**Exceptions** (still ask for):
- Destructive operations
- Security-sensitive operations
- Ambiguous requirements with multiple interpretations
- Major architectural decisions

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES

### Secret Scanning and Protection

**MANDATORY**: Prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

**Protected Patterns**:
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- AWS Access Keys and Secret Keys
- API Keys and Authentication Tokens
- Database Passwords and Connection Strings
- Private Keys and Certificates

**Enforcement**: Automated pre-commit scanning with policy compliance checks.

### Code Quality Standards

**MANDATORY**: All code must meet quality and security standards.

**Requirements**:
- Static analysis and linting
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Code review for all changes
- Automated testing where applicable

---

## üìä MONITORING AND DOCUMENTATION POLICIES

### Real-Time Documentation Policy

**MANDATORY**: Document work as it progresses, not after completion.

**Requirements**:
- Log all commands executed and results
- Capture error messages and solutions
- Document assumptions and validations
- Maintain evidence trails for all decisions

### Audit and Compliance Tracking

**MANDATORY**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails.

**Requirements**:
- Policy compliance reports
- Change tracking and approval
- Security scanning results
- Performance and quality metrics
