# Zenity Status - Cursor Bundle v6.9.32

## Current Status: ⚠️ UNTESTED

### What I Did:
- Rewrote the Zenity script with GUI dialogs
- Added proper error checking
- Script detects headless environment correctly

### What I Did NOT Do:
- Test it actually working in a GUI environment
- Verify the dialogs display properly
- Test the installation process through GUI

### Error Detection Works:
✅ "Error: No display environment detected"
✅ "Zenity requires a GUI environment (X11/Wayland)"

### Actual Functionality: UNKNOWN
❓ May work in GUI environments
❓ Dialogs may or may not display correctly
❓ Installation process untested

### Honest Recommendation:
- Script included but not guaranteed to work
- Use enhanced installer instead: ./14-install_v6.9.32_enhanced.sh
