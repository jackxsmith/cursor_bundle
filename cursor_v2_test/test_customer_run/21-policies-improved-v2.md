## 1. Code Enhancement Policy

### 1.1 General Principles
- All code improvements must be professional and understated
- Maximum file length: **1000 lines**
- Maximum development time per file: **300 seconds (5 minutes)**
- Focus on robust error handling and self-correcting mechanisms
- No "crazy" or fantastical features (consciousness-aware, quantum, etc.)

### 1.2 Enhancement Requirements
- Implement comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- Add professional logging and auditing capabilities
- Include self-correcting configuration management
- Provide graceful degradation strategies
- Ensure thread-safe operations where applicable

### 1.3 Prohibited Features
- Consciousness-aware functionality
- Quantum computing integration
- Reality manipulation capabilities
- Holographic interfaces
- Supernatural or mystical elements

---

## 2. Development Standards

### 2.1 Shell Script Standards
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

# Enhanced error handling required
trap 'error_handler ${LINENO} "$BASH_COMMAND" $?' ERR
trap 'exit 130' INT TERM
```
